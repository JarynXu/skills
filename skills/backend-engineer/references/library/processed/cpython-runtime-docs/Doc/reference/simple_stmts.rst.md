# Simple statements

A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several simple
statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons. The syntax for
simple statements is:

## Expression statements

Expression statements are used (mostly interactively) to compute and write a
value, or (usually) to call a procedure (a function that returns no meaningful
result; in Python, procedures return the value None). Other uses of
expression statements are allowed and occasionally useful. The syntax for an
expression statement is:

An expression statement evaluates the expression list (which may be a single
expression).

In interactive mode, if the value is not None, it is converted to a string
using the built-in :func:`repr` function and the resulting string is written to
standard output on a line by itself (except if the result is None, so that
procedure calls do not cause any output.)

## Assignment statements

Assignment statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to modify
attributes or items of mutable objects:

(See section :ref:`primaries` for the syntax definitions for *attributeref*
and *subscription*.)

An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this can be
a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a tuple) and
assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, from left to
right.

Assignment is defined recursively depending on the form of the target (list).
When a target is part of a mutable object (an attribute reference or
subscription), the mutable object must ultimately perform the assignment and
decide about its validity, and may raise an exception if the assignment is
unacceptable. The rules observed by various types and the exceptions raised are
given with the definition of the object types (see section :ref:`types`).

Assignment of an object to a target list, optionally enclosed in parentheses or
square brackets, is recursively defined as follows.

- If the target list is a single target with no trailing comma,
  optionally in parentheses, the object is assigned to that target.
- Else:

  - If the target list contains one target prefixed with an asterisk, called a
    "starred" target: The object must be an iterable with at least as many items
    as there are targets in the target list, minus one. The first items of the
    iterable are assigned, from left to right, to the targets before the starred
    target. The final items of the iterable are assigned to the targets after
    the starred target. A list of the remaining items in the iterable is then
    assigned to the starred target (the list can be empty).
  - Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there
    are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to
    right, to the corresponding targets.

Assignment of an object to a single target is recursively defined as follows.

- If the target is an identifier (name):

  - If the name does not occur in a :keyword:`global` or :keyword:`nonlocal`
    statement in the current code block: the name is bound to the object in the
    current local namespace.
  - Otherwise: the name is bound to the object in the global namespace or the
    outer namespace determined by :keyword:`nonlocal`, respectively.

  The name is rebound if it was already bound. This may cause the reference
  count for the object previously bound to the name to reach zero, causing the
  object to be deallocated and its destructor (if it has one) to be called.
- If the target is an attribute reference: The primary expression in the
  reference is evaluated. It should yield an object with assignable attributes;
  if this is not the case, :exc:`TypeError` is raised. That object is then
  asked to assign the assigned object to the given attribute; if it cannot
  perform the assignment, it raises an exception (usually but not necessarily
  :exc:`AttributeError`).

  Note: If the object is a class instance and the attribute reference occurs on
  both sides of the assignment operator, the right-hand side expression, a.x can access
  either an instance attribute or (if no instance attribute exists) a class
  attribute. The left-hand side target a.x is always set as an instance attribute,
  creating it if necessary. Thus, the two occurrences of a.x do not
  necessarily refer to the same attribute: if the right-hand side expression refers to a
  class attribute, the left-hand side creates a new instance attribute as the target of the
  assignment:

  ```
  class Cls:
      x = 3             # class variable
  inst = Cls()
  inst.x = inst.x + 1   # writes inst.x as 4 leaving Cls.x as 3
  ```

  This description does not necessarily apply to descriptor attributes, such as
  properties created with :deco:`property`.
- If the target is a subscription: The primary expression in the reference is
  evaluated.
  Next, the subscript expression is evaluated.
  Then, the primary's :meth:`~object.\_\_setitem\_\_` method is called with
  two arguments: the subscript and the assigned object.

  Typically, :meth:`~object.\_\_setitem\_\_` is defined on mutable sequence objects
  (such as lists) and mapping objects (such as dictionaries), and behaves as
  follows.

  If the primary is a mutable sequence object (such as a list), the subscript
  must yield an integer. If it is negative, the sequence's length is added to
  it. The resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less than the
  sequence's length, and the sequence is asked to assign the assigned object to
  its item with that index. If the index is out of range, :exc:`IndexError` is
  raised (assignment to a subscripted sequence cannot add new items to a list).

  If the primary is a mapping object (such as a dictionary), the subscript must
  have a type compatible with the mapping's key type, and the mapping is then
  asked to create a key/value pair which maps the subscript to the assigned
  object. This can either replace an existing key/value pair with the same key
  value, or insert a new key/value pair (if no key with the same value existed).

  If the target is a slicing: The primary expression should evaluate to
  a mutable sequence object (such as a list).
  The assigned object should be :term:`iterable`.
  The slicing's lower and upper bounds should be integers; if they are None
  (or not present), the defaults are zero and the sequence's length.
  If either bound is negative, the sequence's length is added to it. The
  resulting bounds are clipped to lie between zero and the sequence's length,
  inclusive. Finally, the sequence object is asked to replace the slice with
  the items of the assigned sequence. The length of the slice may be different
  from the length of the assigned sequence, thus changing the length of the
  target sequence, if the target sequence allows it.

Although the definition of assignment implies that overlaps between the
left-hand side and the right-hand side are 'simultaneous' (for example a, b = b, a swaps two variables), overlaps *within* the collection of assigned-to
variables occur left-to-right, sometimes resulting in confusion. For instance,
the following program prints [0, 2]:

```
x = [0, 1]
i = 0
i, x[i] = 1, 2         # i is updated, then x[i] is updated
print(x)
```

### Augmented assignment statements

Augmented assignment is the combination, in a single statement, of a binary
operation and an assignment statement:

(See section :ref:`primaries` for the syntax definitions of the last three
symbols.)

An augmented assignment evaluates the target (which, unlike normal assignment
statements, cannot be an unpacking) and the expression list, performs the binary
operation specific to the type of assignment on the two operands, and assigns
the result to the original target. The target is only evaluated once.

An augmented assignment statement like x += 1 can be rewritten as x = x + 1 to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented
version, x is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, the actual operation
is performed *in-place*, meaning that rather than creating a new object and
assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead.

Unlike normal assignments, augmented assignments evaluate the left-hand side
*before* evaluating the right-hand side. For example, a[i] += f(x) first
looks-up a[i], then it evaluates f(x) and performs the addition, and
lastly, it writes the result back to a[i].

With the exception of assigning to tuples and multiple targets in a single
statement, the assignment done by augmented assignment statements is handled the
same way as normal assignments. Similarly, with the exception of the possible
*in-place* behavior, the binary operation performed by augmented assignment is
the same as the normal binary operations.

For targets which are attribute references, the same :ref:`caveat about class
and instance attributes <attr-target-note>` applies as for regular assignments.

### Annotated assignment statements

:term:`Annotation <variable annotation>` assignment is the combination, in a single
statement, of a variable or attribute annotation and an optional assignment statement:

The difference from normal :ref:`assignment` is that only a single target is allowed.

The assignment target is considered "simple" if it consists of a single
name that is not enclosed in parentheses.
For simple assignment targets, if in class or module scope,
the annotations are gathered in a lazily evaluated
:ref:`annotation scope <annotation-scopes>`. The annotations can be
evaluated using the :attr:`~object.\_\_annotations\_\_` attribute of a
class or module, or using the facilities in the :mod:`annotationlib`
module.

If the assignment target is not simple (an attribute, subscript node, or
parenthesized name), the annotation is never evaluated.

If a name is annotated in a function scope, then this name is local for
that scope. Annotations are never evaluated and stored in function scopes.

If the right hand side is present, an annotated
assignment performs the actual assignment as if there was no annotation
present. If the right hand side is not present for an expression
target, then the interpreter evaluates the target except for the last
:meth:`~object.\_\_setitem\_\_` or :meth:`~object.\_\_setattr\_\_` call.

## The :keyword:`!assert` statement

Assert statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions into a
program:

The simple form, assert expression, is equivalent to

```
if __debug__:
    if not expression: raise AssertionError
```

The extended form, assert expression1, expression2, is equivalent to

```
if __debug__:
    if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)
```

These equivalences assume that :const:`\_\_debug\_\_` and :exc:`AssertionError` refer to
the built-in variables with those names. In the current implementation, the
built-in variable \_\_debug\_\_ is True under normal circumstances,
False when optimization is requested (command line option :option:`-O`). The current
code generator emits no code for an :keyword:`assert` statement when optimization is
requested at compile time. Note that it is unnecessary to include the source
code for the expression that failed in the error message; it will be displayed
as part of the stack trace.

Assignments to :const:`\_\_debug\_\_` are illegal. The value for the built-in variable
is determined when the interpreter starts.

## The :keyword:`!pass` statement

:keyword:`pass` is a null operation --- when it is executed, nothing happens.
It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no
code needs to be executed, for example:

```
def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)
```

## The :keyword:`!del` statement

Deletion is recursively defined very similar to the way assignment is defined.
Rather than spelling it out in full details, here are some hints.

Deletion of a target list recursively deletes each target, from left to right.

Deletion of a name removes the binding of that name from the local or global
namespace, depending on whether the name occurs in a :keyword:`global` statement
in the same code block. Trying to delete an unbound name raises a
:exc:`NameError` exception.

Deletion of attribute references and subscriptions is passed to the
primary object involved; deletion of a slicing is in general equivalent to
assignment of an empty slice of the right type (but even this is determined by
the sliced object).

## The :keyword:`!return` statement

:keyword:`return` may only occur syntactically nested in a function definition,
not within a nested class definition.

If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else None is substituted.

:keyword:`return` leaves the current function call with the expression list (or
None) as return value.

When :keyword:`return` passes control out of a :keyword:`try` statement with a
:keyword:`finally` clause, that :keyword:`!finally` clause is executed before
really leaving the function.

In a generator function, the :keyword:`return` statement indicates that the
generator is done and will cause :exc:`StopIteration` to be raised. The returned
value (if any) is used as an argument to construct :exc:`StopIteration` and
becomes the :attr:`StopIteration.value` attribute.

In an asynchronous generator function, an empty :keyword:`return` statement
indicates that the asynchronous generator is done and will cause
:exc:`StopAsyncIteration` to be raised. A non-empty :keyword:`!return`
statement is a syntax error in an asynchronous generator function.

## The :keyword:`!yield` statement

A :keyword:`yield` statement is semantically equivalent to a :ref:`yield
expression <yieldexpr>`. The yield statement can be used to omit the
parentheses that would otherwise be required in the equivalent yield expression
statement. For example, the yield statements

```
yield <expr>
yield from <expr>
```

are equivalent to the yield expression statements

```
(yield <expr>)
(yield from <expr>)
```

Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a :term:`generator`
function, and are only used in the body of the generator function. Using :keyword:`yield`
in a function definition is sufficient to cause that definition to create a
generator function instead of a normal function.

For full details of :keyword:`yield` semantics, refer to the
:ref:`yieldexpr` section.

## The :keyword:`!raise` statement

If no expressions are present, :keyword:`raise` re-raises the
exception that is currently being handled, which is also known as the *active exception*.
If there isn't currently an active exception, a :exc:`RuntimeError` exception is raised
indicating that this is an error.

Otherwise, :keyword:`raise` evaluates the first expression as the exception
object. It must be either a subclass or an instance of :class:`BaseException`.
If it is a class, the exception instance will be obtained when needed by
instantiating the class with no arguments.

The :dfn:`type` of the exception is the exception instance's class, the
:dfn:`value` is the instance itself.

A traceback object is normally created automatically when an exception is raised
and attached to it as the :attr:`~BaseException.\_\_traceback\_\_` attribute.
You can create an exception and set your own traceback in one step using the
:meth:`~BaseException.with\_traceback` exception method (which returns the
same exception instance, with its traceback set to its argument), like so:

```
raise Exception("foo occurred").with_traceback(tracebackobj)
```

The from clause is used for exception chaining: if given, the second
*expression* must be another exception class or instance. If the second
expression is an exception instance, it will be attached to the raised
exception as the :attr:`~BaseException.\_\_cause\_\_` attribute (which is writable). If the
expression is an exception class, the class will be instantiated and the
resulting exception instance will be attached to the raised exception as the
:attr:`!\_\_cause\_\_` attribute. If the raised exception is not handled, both
exceptions will be printed:

```
>>> try:
...     print(1 / 0)
... except Exception as exc:
...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") from exc
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
    print(1 / 0)
          ~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened") from exc
RuntimeError: Something bad happened
```

A similar mechanism works implicitly if a new exception is raised when
an exception is already being handled. An exception may be handled
when an :keyword:`except` or :keyword:`finally` clause, or a
:keyword:`with` statement, is used. The previous exception is then
attached as the new exception's :attr:`~BaseException.\_\_context\_\_` attribute:

```
>>> try:
...     print(1 / 0)
... except:
...     raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
    print(1 / 0)
          ~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError("Something bad happened")
RuntimeError: Something bad happened
```

Exception chaining can be explicitly suppressed by specifying :const:`None` in
the from clause:

Additional information on exceptions can be found in section :ref:`exceptions`,
and information about handling exceptions is in section :ref:`try`.

## The :keyword:`!break` statement

:keyword:`break` may only occur syntactically nested in a :keyword:`for` or
:keyword:`while` loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within
that loop.

It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional :keyword:`!else`
clause if the loop has one.

If a :keyword:`for` loop is terminated by :keyword:`break`, the loop control
target keeps its current value.

When :keyword:`break` passes control out of a :keyword:`try` statement with a
:keyword:`finally` clause, that :keyword:`!finally` clause is executed before
really leaving the loop.

## The :keyword:`!continue` statement

:keyword:`continue` may only occur syntactically nested in a :keyword:`for` or
:keyword:`while` loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within
that loop. It continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.

When :keyword:`continue` passes control out of a :keyword:`try` statement with a
:keyword:`finally` clause, that :keyword:`!finally` clause is executed before
really starting the next loop cycle.

## The :keyword:`!import` statement

The basic import statement (no :keyword:`from` clause) is executed in two
steps:

1. find a module, loading and initializing it if necessary
2. define a name or names in the current namespace for the scope where
   the :keyword:`import` statement occurs, just as an assignment statement
   would (including :keyword:`global` and :keyword:`nonlocal` semantics).

When the statement contains multiple clauses (separated by
commas) the two steps are carried out separately for each clause, just
as though the clauses had been separated out into individual import
statements.

The details of the first step, finding and loading modules, are described in
greater detail in the section on the :ref:`import system <importsystem>`,
which also describes the various types of packages and modules that can
be imported, as well as all the hooks that can be used to customize
the import system. Note that failures in this step may indicate either
that the module could not be located, *or* that an error occurred while
initializing the module, which includes execution of the module's code.

If the requested module is retrieved successfully, it will be made
available in the local namespace in one of three ways:

- If the module name is followed by :keyword:`!as`, then the name
  following :keyword:`!as` is bound directly to the imported module.
- If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a top
  level module, the module's name is bound in the local namespace as a
  reference to the imported module
- If the module being imported is *not* a top level module, then the name
  of the top level package that contains the module is bound in the local
  namespace as a reference to the top level package. The imported module
  must be accessed using its full qualified name rather than directly

The :keyword:`from` form uses a slightly more complex process:

1. find the module specified in the :keyword:`from` clause, loading and
   initializing it if necessary;
2. for each of the identifiers specified in the :keyword:`import` clauses:

   1. check if the imported module has an attribute by that name
   2. if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then
      check the imported module again for that attribute
   3. if the attribute is not found, :exc:`ImportError` is raised.
   4. otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the current namespace,
      using the name in the :keyword:`!as` clause if it is present,
      otherwise using the attribute name

Examples:

```
import foo                 # foo imported and bound locally
import foo.bar.baz         # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo bound locally
import foo.bar.baz as fbb  # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as fbb
from foo.bar import baz    # foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz imported, foo.bar.baz bound as baz
from foo import attr       # foo imported and foo.attr bound as attr
```

If the list of identifiers is replaced by a star ('\*'), all public
names defined in the module are bound in the local namespace for the scope
where the :keyword:`import` statement occurs.

The *public names* defined by a module are determined by checking the module's
namespace for a variable named \_\_all\_\_; if defined, it must be a sequence
of strings which are names defined or imported by that module.
Names containing non-ASCII characters must be in the [normalization form](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms)
NFKC; see :ref:`lexical-names-nonascii` for details. The names
given in \_\_all\_\_ are all considered public and are required to exist. If
\_\_all\_\_ is not defined, the set of public names includes all names found
in the module's namespace which do not begin with an underscore character
('\_'). \_\_all\_\_ should contain the entire public API. It is intended
to avoid accidentally exporting items that are not part of the API (such as
library modules which were imported and used within the module).

The wild card form of import --- from module import \* --- is only allowed at
the module level. Attempting to use it in class or function definitions will
raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`.

When specifying what module to import you do not have to specify the absolute
name of the module. When a module or package is contained within another
package it is possible to make a relative import within the same top package
without having to mention the package name. By using leading dots in the
specified module or package after :keyword:`from` you can specify how high to
traverse up the current package hierarchy without specifying exact names. One
leading dot means the current package where the module making the import
exists. Two dots means up one package level. Three dots is up two levels, etc.
So if you execute from . import mod from a module in the pkg package
then you will end up importing pkg.mod. If you execute from ..subpkg2 import mod from within pkg.subpkg1 you will import pkg.subpkg2.mod.
The specification for relative imports is contained in
the :ref:`relativeimports` section.

:func:`importlib.import\_module` is provided to support applications that
determine dynamically the modules to be loaded.

### Lazy imports

The :keyword:`lazy` keyword is a :ref:`soft keyword <soft-keywords>` that
only has special meaning when it appears immediately before an
:keyword:`import` or :keyword:`from` statement. When an import statement is
preceded by the :keyword:`lazy` keyword, the import becomes *lazy*: the
module is not loaded immediately at the import statement. Instead, a lazy
proxy object is created and bound to the name. The actual module is loaded
on first use of that name.

Lazy imports are only permitted at module scope. Using :keyword:`lazy`
inside a function, class body, or
:keyword:`try`/:keyword:`except`/:keyword:`finally` block raises a
:exc:`SyntaxError`. Star imports cannot be lazy (lazy from module import \* is a syntax error), and :ref:`future statements <future>` cannot be
lazy.

When using lazy from ... import, each imported name is bound to a lazy
proxy object. The first access to any of these names triggers loading of the
entire module and resolves only that specific name to its actual value.
Other names remain as lazy proxies until they are accessed.

Example:

```
lazy import json
import sys

print('json' in sys.modules)  # False - json module not yet loaded

# First use triggers loading
result = json.dumps({"hello": "world"})

print('json' in sys.modules)  # True - now loaded
```

If an error occurs during module loading (such as :exc:`ImportError` or
:exc:`SyntaxError`), it is raised at the point where the lazy import is first
used, not at the import statement itself.

See [PEP 810](https://peps.python.org/pep-0810) for the full specification of lazy imports.

#### Compatibility via \_\_lazy\_modules\_\_

As an alternative to using the :keyword:`lazy` keyword, a module can opt
into lazy loading for specific imports by defining a module-level
:attr:`~module.\_\_lazy\_modules\_\_` variable. When present, it must be a
container of fully qualified module name strings. Any regular (non-lazy)
:keyword:`import` statement at module scope whose target appears in
:attr:`!\_\_lazy\_modules\_\_` is treated as a lazy import, exactly as if the
:keyword:`lazy` keyword had been used.

This provides a way to enable lazy loading for specific dependencies without
changing individual import statements. This is useful when supporting
Python versions older than 3.15 while using lazy imports in 3.15+:

```
__lazy_modules__ = ["json", "pathlib"]

import json     # loaded lazily (name is in __lazy_modules__)
import os       # loaded eagerly (name not in __lazy_modules__)

import pathlib  # loaded lazily
```

Relative imports are resolved to their absolute name before the lookup, so
:attr:`!\_\_lazy\_modules\_\_` must always contain fully qualified module names.

For from-style imports, the relevant name is the module following
from, not the names of its members:

```
# In mypackage/mymodule.py
__lazy_modules__ = ["mypackage", "mypackage.sub.utils"]

from . import helper         # loaded lazily: . resolves to mypackage
from .sub.utils import func  # loaded lazily: .sub.utils resolves to mypackage.sub.utils
import json                  # loaded eagerly (not in __lazy_modules__)
```

Imports inside functions, class bodies, or
:keyword:`try`/:keyword:`except`/:keyword:`finally` blocks are always eager,
regardless of :attr:`!\_\_lazy\_modules\_\_`.

### Future statements

A :dfn:`future statement` is a directive to the compiler that a particular
module should be compiled using syntax or semantics that will be available in a
specified future release of Python where the feature becomes standard.

The future statement is intended to ease migration to future versions of Python
that introduce incompatible changes to the language. It allows use of the new
features on a per-module basis before the release in which the feature becomes
standard.

A future statement must appear near the top of the module. The only lines that
can appear before a future statement are:

- the module docstring (if any),
- comments,
- blank lines, and
- other future statements.

The only feature that requires using the future statement is
annotations (see [PEP 563](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563)).

All historical features enabled by the future statement are still recognized
by Python 3. The list includes absolute\_import, division,
generators, generator\_stop, unicode\_literals,
print\_function, nested\_scopes and with\_statement. They are
all redundant because they are always enabled, and only kept for
backwards compatibility.

A future statement is recognized and treated specially at compile time: Changes
to the semantics of core constructs are often implemented by generating
different code. It may even be the case that a new feature introduces new
incompatible syntax (such as a new reserved word), in which case the compiler
may need to parse the module differently. Such decisions cannot be pushed off
until runtime.

For any given release, the compiler knows which feature names have been defined,
and raises a compile-time error if a future statement contains a feature not
known to it.

The direct runtime semantics are the same as for any import statement: there is
a standard module :mod:`\_\_future\_\_`, described later, and it will be imported in
the usual way at the time the future statement is executed.

The interesting runtime semantics depend on the specific feature enabled by the
future statement.

Note that there is nothing special about the statement:

```
import __future__ [as name]
```

That is not a future statement; it's an ordinary import statement with no
special semantics or syntax restrictions.

Code compiled by calls to the built-in functions :func:`exec` and :func:`compile`
that occur in a module :mod:`!M` containing a future statement will, by default,
use the new syntax or semantics associated with the future statement. This can
be controlled by optional arguments to :func:`compile` --- see the documentation
of that function for details.

A future statement typed at an interactive interpreter prompt will take effect
for the rest of the interpreter session. If an interpreter is started with the
:option:`-i` option, is passed a script name to execute, and the script includes
a future statement, it will be in effect in the interactive session started
after the script is executed.

## The :keyword:`!global` statement

The :keyword:`global` statement causes the listed identifiers to be interpreted
as globals. It would be impossible to assign to a global variable without
:keyword:`!global`, although free variables may refer to globals without being
declared global.

The :keyword:`!global` statement applies to the entire current scope
(module, function body or class definition).
A :exc:`SyntaxError` is raised if a variable is used or
assigned to prior to its global declaration in the scope.

At the module level, all variables are global, so a :keyword:`!global`
statement has no effect.
However, variables must still not be used or
assigned to prior to their :keyword:`!global` declaration.
This requirement is relaxed in the interactive prompt (:term:`REPL`).

**Programmer's note:** :keyword:`global` is a directive to the parser. It
applies only to code parsed at the same time as the :keyword:`!global` statement.
In particular, a :keyword:`!global` statement contained in a string or code
object supplied to the built-in :func:`exec` function does not affect the code
block *containing* the function call, and code contained in such a string is
unaffected by :keyword:`!global` statements in the code containing the function
call. The same applies to the :func:`eval` and :func:`compile` functions.

## The :keyword:`!nonlocal` statement

When the definition of a function or class is nested (enclosed) within
the definitions of other functions, its nonlocal scopes are the local
scopes of the enclosing functions. The :keyword:`nonlocal` statement
causes the listed identifiers to refer to names previously bound in
nonlocal scopes. It allows encapsulated code to rebind such nonlocal
identifiers. If a name is bound in more than one nonlocal scope, the
nearest binding is used. If a name is not bound in any nonlocal scope,
or if there is no nonlocal scope, a :exc:`SyntaxError` is raised.

The :keyword:`nonlocal` statement applies to the entire scope of a function or
class body. A :exc:`SyntaxError` is raised if a variable is used or
assigned to prior to its nonlocal declaration in the scope.

**Programmer's note:** :keyword:`nonlocal` is a directive to the parser
and applies only to code parsed along with it. See the note for the
:keyword:`global` statement.

## The :keyword:`!type` statement

The :keyword:`!type` statement declares a type alias, which is an instance
of :class:`typing.TypeAliasType`.

For example, the following statement creates a type alias:

```
type Point = tuple[float, float]
```

This code is roughly equivalent to:

```
annotation-def VALUE_OF_Point():
    return tuple[float, float]
Point = typing.TypeAliasType("Point", VALUE_OF_Point())
```

annotation-def indicates an :ref:`annotation scope <annotation-scopes>`, which behaves
mostly like a function, but with several small differences.

The value of the
type alias is evaluated in the annotation scope. It is not evaluated when the
type alias is created, but only when the value is accessed through the type alias's
:attr:`!\_\_value\_\_` attribute (see :ref:`lazy-evaluation`).
This allows the type alias to refer to names that are not yet defined.

Type aliases may be made generic by adding a :ref:`type parameter list <type-params>`
after the name. See :ref:`generic-type-aliases` for more.

:keyword:`!type` is a :ref:`soft keyword <soft-keywords>`.
