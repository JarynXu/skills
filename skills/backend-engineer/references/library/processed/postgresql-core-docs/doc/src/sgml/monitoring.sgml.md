## Monitoring Database Activity

  monitoring


  A database administrator frequently wonders, What is the system
  doing right now?
  This chapter discusses how to find that out.


   Several tools are available for monitoring database activity and
   analyzing performance.  Most of this chapter is devoted to describing
   PostgreSQL's cumulative statistics system,
   but one should not neglect regular Unix monitoring programs such as
   ps, top, iostat, and vmstat.
   Also, once one has identified a
   poorly-performing query, further investigation might be needed using
   PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN command.
    discusses EXPLAIN
   and other methods for understanding the behavior of an individual
   query.


## Standard Unix Tools


   ps
   to monitor activity


   On most Unix platforms, PostgreSQL modifies its
   command title as reported by ps, so that individual server
   processes can readily be identified.  A sample display is


```
$ ps auxww | grep ^postgres
postgres  15551  0.0  0.1  57536  7132 pts/0    S    18:02   0:00 postgres -i
postgres  15554  0.0  0.0  57536  1184 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: background writer
postgres  15555  0.0  0.0  57536   916 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: checkpointer
postgres  15556  0.0  0.0  57536   916 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: walwriter
postgres  15557  0.0  0.0  58504  2244 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 postgres: autovacuum launcher
postgres  15582  0.0  0.0  58772  3080 ?        Ss   18:04   0:00 postgres: joe runbug 127.0.0.1 idle
postgres  15606  0.0  0.0  58772  3052 ?        Ss   18:07   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] SELECT waiting
postgres  15610  0.0  0.0  58772  3056 ?        Ss   18:07   0:00 postgres: tgl regression [local] idle in transaction
```


   (The appropriate invocation of ps varies across different
   platforms, as do the details of what is shown.  This example is from a
   recent Linux system.)  The first process listed here is the
   primary server process.  The command arguments
   shown for it are the same ones used when it was launched.  The next four
   processes are background worker processes automatically launched by the
   primary process.  (The autovacuum launcher process will not
   be present if you have set the system not to run autovacuum.)
   Each of the remaining
   processes is a server process handling one client connection.  Each such
   process sets its command line display in the form


```
postgres: user database host activity
```


  The user, database, and (client) host items remain the same for
  the life of the client connection, but the activity indicator changes.
  The activity can be idle (i.e., waiting for a client command),
  idle in transaction (waiting for client inside a BEGIN block),
  or a command type name such as SELECT.  Also,
  waiting is appended if the server process is presently waiting
  on a lock held by another session.  In the above example we can infer
  that process 15606 is waiting for process 15610 to complete its transaction
  and thereby release some lock.  (Process 15610 must be the blocker, because
  there is no other active session.  In more complicated cases it would be
  necessary to look into the
  pg_locks
  system view to determine who is blocking whom.)


   If  has been configured the
   cluster name will also be shown in ps output:


```
$ psql -c 'SHOW cluster_name'
 cluster_name
--------------
 server1
(1 row)

$ ps aux|grep server1
postgres   27093  0.0  0.0  30096  2752 ?        Ss   11:34   0:00 postgres: server1: background writer
...
```


   If you have turned off  then the
   activity indicator is not updated; the process title is set only once
   when a new process is launched.  On some platforms this saves a measurable
   amount of per-command overhead;  on others it's insignificant.


  Solaris requires special handling. You must
  use /usr/ucb/ps, rather than
  /bin/ps. You also must use two w
  flags, not just one. In addition, your original invocation of the
  postgres command must have a shorter
  ps status display than that provided by each
  server process.  If you fail to do all three things, the ps
  output for each server process will be the original postgres
  command line.


## The Cumulative Statistics System


   statistics


   PostgreSQL's cumulative statistics
   system supports collection and reporting of information about
   server activity.  Presently, accesses to tables and indexes in both
   disk-block and individual-row terms are counted.  The total number of rows
   in each table, and information about vacuum and analyze actions for each
   table are also counted.  If enabled, calls to user-defined functions and
   the total time spent in each one are counted as well.


   PostgreSQL also supports reporting dynamic
   information about exactly what is going on in the system right now, such as
   the exact command currently being executed by other server processes, and
   which other connections exist in the system.  This facility is independent
   of the cumulative statistics system.


## Statistics Collection Configuration


   Since collection of statistics adds some overhead to query execution,
   the system can be configured to collect or not collect information.
   This is controlled by configuration parameters that are normally set in
   postgresql.conf.  (See  for
   details about setting configuration parameters.)


   The parameter  enables monitoring
   of the current command being executed by any server process.


   The parameter  enables
   monitoring of cost-based vacuum delay.


   The parameter  controls whether
   cumulative statistics are collected about table and index accesses.


   The parameter  enables tracking of
   usage of user-defined functions.


   The parameter  enables monitoring
   of block read, write, extend, and fsync times.


   The parameter  enables monitoring
   of WAL read, write and fsync times.


   Normally these parameters are set in postgresql.conf so
   that they apply to all server processes, but it is possible to turn
   them on or off in individual sessions using the  command. (To prevent
   ordinary users from hiding their activity from the administrator,
   only superusers are allowed to change these parameters with
   SET.)


   Cumulative statistics are collected in shared memory. Every
   PostgreSQL process collects statistics locally,
   then updates the shared data at appropriate intervals.  When a server,
   including a physical replica, shuts down cleanly, a permanent copy of the
   statistics data is stored in the pg_stat subdirectory,
   so that statistics can be retained across server restarts.  In contrast,
   when starting from an unclean shutdown (e.g., after an immediate shutdown,
   a server crash, starting from a base backup, and point-in-time recovery),
   all statistics counters are reset.


## Viewing Statistics


   Several predefined views, listed in , are available to show
   the current state of the system. There are also several other
   views, listed in , available to show the accumulated
   statistics.  Alternatively, one can
   build custom views using the underlying cumulative statistics functions, as
   discussed in .


   When using the cumulative statistics views and functions to monitor
   collected data, it is important to realize that the information does not
   update instantaneously.  Each individual server process flushes out
   accumulated statistics to shared memory just before going idle, but not
   more frequently than once per PGSTAT_MIN_INTERVAL
   milliseconds (1 second unless altered while building the server); so a
   query or transaction still in progress does not affect the displayed totals
   and the displayed information lags behind actual activity.  However,
   current-query information collected by track_activities
   is always up-to-date.


   Another important point is that when a server process is asked to display
   any of the accumulated statistics, accessed values are cached until the end
   of its current transaction in the default configuration. So the statistics
   will show static information as long as you continue the current
   transaction. Similarly, information about the current queries of all
   sessions is collected when any such information is first requested within a
   transaction, and the same information will be displayed throughout the
   transaction. This is a feature, not a bug, because it allows you to perform
   several queries on the statistics and correlate the results without
   worrying that the numbers are changing underneath you.

   When analyzing statistics interactively, or with expensive queries, the
   time delta between accesses to individual statistics can lead to
   significant skew in the cached statistics. To minimize skew,
   stats_fetch_consistency can be set to
   snapshot, at the price of increased memory usage for
   caching not-needed statistics data.  Conversely, if it's known that
   statistics are only accessed once, caching accessed statistics is
   unnecessary and can be avoided by setting
   stats_fetch_consistency to none.

   You can invoke pg_stat_clear_snapshot() to discard the
   current transaction's statistics snapshot or cached values (if any).  The
   next use of statistical information will (when in snapshot mode) cause a
   new snapshot to be built or (when in cache mode) accessed statistics to be
   cached.


   A transaction can also see its own statistics (not yet flushed out to the
   shared memory statistics) in the views
   pg_stat_xact_all_tables,
   pg_stat_xact_sys_tables,
   pg_stat_xact_user_tables, and
   pg_stat_xact_user_functions.  These numbers do not act as
   stated above; instead they update continuously throughout the transaction.


   Some of the information in the dynamic statistics views shown in  is security restricted.
   Ordinary users can only see all the information about their own sessions
   (sessions belonging to a role that they are a member of).  In rows about
   other sessions, many columns will be null.  Note, however, that the
   existence of a session and its general properties such as its sessions user
   and database are visible to all users.  Superusers and roles with privileges of
   built-in role pg_read_all_stats
   can see all the information about all sessions.

   The per-index statistics are particularly useful to determine which
   indexes are being used and how effective they are.


   The pg_stat_io and
   pg_statio_ set of views are useful for determining
   the effectiveness of the buffer cache. They can be used to calculate a cache
   hit ratio. Note that while PostgreSQL's I/O
   statistics capture most instances in which the kernel was invoked in order
   to perform I/O, they do not differentiate between data which had to be
   fetched from disk and that which already resided in the kernel page cache.
   Users are advised to use the PostgreSQL
   statistics views in combination with operating system utilities for a more
   complete picture of their database's I/O performance.


## pg_stat_activity


   pg_stat_activity


   The pg_stat_activity view will have one row
   per server process, showing information related to
   the current activity of that process.

       to this backend


       client_addr inet


       IP address of the client connected to this backend.
       If this field is null, it indicates either that the client is
       connected via a Unix socket on the server machine or that this is an
       internal process such as autovacuum.


       client_hostname text


       Host name of the connected client, as reported by a
       reverse DNS lookup of client_addr. This field will
       only be non-null for IP connections, and only when  is enabled.

       TCP port number that the client is using for communication
       with this backend, or -1 if a Unix socket is used.
       If this field is null, it indicates that this is an internal server process.


       backend_start timestamp with time zone

       Time when this process' current transaction was started, or null
       if no transaction is active. If the current
       query is the first of its transaction, this column is equal to the
       query_start column.


       query_start timestamp with time zone


       Time when the currently active query was started, or if

          but is not currently executing a query.


-


          idle in transaction (aborted): This state is similar to
          idle in transaction, except one of the statements in
          the transaction caused an error.


-


          fastpath function call: The backend is executing a
          fast-path function.


-


          disabled: This state is reported if  is disabled in this backend.

      Identifier of this backend's most recent query. If
      state is active this
      field shows the identifier of the currently executing query. In
      all other states, it shows the identifier of last query that was
      executed.  Query identifiers are not computed by default so this
      field will be null unless
      parameter is enabled or a third-party module that computes query
      identifiers is configured.


       query text


       Text of this backend's most recent query. If
       state is active this field shows the
       currently executing query. In all other states, it shows the last query
       that was executed. By default the query text is truncated at 1024
       bytes; this value can be changed via the parameter
       .


       backend_type text

       In addition, background workers registered by extensions may have
       additional types.


    The wait_event and state columns are
    independent.  If a backend is in the active state,
    it may or may not be waiting on some event.  If the state
    is active and wait_event is non-null, it
    means that a query is being executed, but is being blocked somewhere
    in the system.  To keep the reporting overhead low, the system does not
    attempt to synchronize different aspects of activity data for a backend.
    As a result, ephemeral discrepancies may exist between the view's columns.


## Wait Event Types


      Wait Event Type
      Description


      Activity
      The server process is idle.  This event type indicates a process
       waiting for activity in its main processing loop.
       wait_event will identify the specific wait point;
       see .


      Buffer
      The server process is waiting for access to a data buffer.
      See .


      Client
      The server process is waiting for activity on a socket
       connected to a user application.  Thus, the server expects something
       to happen that is independent of its internal processes.
       wait_event will identify the specific wait point;
       see .


      Extension
      The server process is waiting for some condition defined by an
       extension module.
       See .


      InjectionPoint
      The server process is waiting for an injection point to reach an
       outcome defined in a test.  See
        for more details.  This
       type has no predefined wait points.


      IO
      The server process is waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
       wait_event will identify the specific wait point;
       see .


      IPC
      The server process is waiting for some interaction with
       another server process.  wait_event will
       identify the specific wait point;
       see .


      Lock
      The server process is waiting for a heavyweight lock.
       Heavyweight locks, also known as lock manager locks or simply locks,
       primarily protect SQL-visible objects such as tables.  However,
       they are also used to ensure mutual exclusion for certain internal
       operations such as relation extension.  wait_event
       will identify the type of lock awaited;
       see .


      LWLock
       The server process is waiting for a lightweight lock.
       Most such locks protect a particular data structure in shared memory.
       wait_event will contain a name identifying the purpose
       of the lightweight lock.  (Some locks have specific names; others
       are part of a group of locks each with a similar purpose.)
       See .


      Timeout
      The server process is waiting for a timeout
       to expire.  wait_event will identify the specific wait
       point; see .


  &wait_event_types;


     Here are examples of how wait events can be viewed:


```
SELECT pid, wait_event_type, wait_event FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL;
 pid  | wait_event_type | wait_event
------+-----------------+------------
 2540 | Lock            | relation
 6644 | LWLock          | ProcArray
(2 rows)
```


```
SELECT a.pid, a.wait_event, w.description
  FROM pg_stat_activity a JOIN
       pg_wait_events w ON (a.wait_event_type = w.type AND
                            a.wait_event = w.name)
  WHERE a.wait_event IS NOT NULL AND a.state = 'active';
-[ RECORD 1 ]------------------------------------------------------&zwsp;------------
pid         | 686674
wait_event  | WALInitSync
description | Waiting for a newly initialized WAL file to reach durable storage
```


     Extensions can add Extension,
     InjectionPoint, and LWLock events
     to the lists shown in  and
     . In some cases, the name
     of an LWLock assigned by an extension will not be
     available in all server processes.  It might be reported as just
     extension rather than the
     extension-assigned name.


## pg_stat_replication


   pg_stat_replication


   The pg_stat_replication view will contain one row
   per WAL sender process, showing statistics about replication to that
   sender's connected standby server.  Only directly connected standbys are
   listed; no information is available about downstream standby servers.


## pg_stat_replication View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of a WAL sender process


       usesysid oid


       OID of the user logged into this WAL sender process


       usename name


       Name of the user logged into this WAL sender process


       application_name text


       Name of the application that is connected
       to this WAL sender


       client_addr inet


       IP address of the client connected to this WAL sender.
       If this field is null, it indicates that the client is
       connected via a Unix socket on the server machine.


       client_hostname text


       Host name of the connected client, as reported by a
       reverse DNS lookup of client_addr. This field will
       only be non-null for IP connections, and only when  is enabled.


       client_port integer


       TCP port number that the client is using for communication
       with this WAL sender, or -1 if a Unix socket is used


       backend_start timestamp with time zone


       Time when this process was started, i.e., when the
       client connected to this WAL sender


       backend_xmin xid


       This standby's xmin horizon reported
       by .
       This field will be null if a replication slot is used (in this case,
       the standby's xmin is shown in
       pg_replication_slots)
       or if hot_standby_feedback is disabled.


       state text


       Current WAL sender state.
       Possible values are:


-


          startup: This WAL sender is starting up.


-


          catchup: This WAL sender's connected standby is
          catching up with the primary.


-


          streaming: This WAL sender is streaming changes
          after its connected standby server has caught up with the primary.


-


          backup: This WAL sender is sending a backup.


-


          stopping: This WAL sender is stopping.


       sent_lsn pg_lsn


       Last write-ahead log location sent on this connection


       write_lsn pg_lsn


       Last write-ahead log location written to disk by this standby
       server


       flush_lsn pg_lsn


       Last write-ahead log location flushed to disk by this standby
       server


       replay_lsn pg_lsn


       Last write-ahead log location replayed into the database on this
       standby server


       write_lag interval


       Time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving
       notification that this standby server has written it (but not yet
       flushed it or applied it).  This can be used to gauge the delay that
       synchronous_commit level
       remote_write incurred while committing if this
       server was configured as a synchronous standby.


       flush_lag interval


       Time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving
       notification that this standby server has written and flushed it
       (but not yet applied it).  This can be used to gauge the delay that
       synchronous_commit level
       on incurred while committing if this
       server was configured as a synchronous standby.


       replay_lag interval


       Time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving
       notification that this standby server has written, flushed and
       applied it.  This can be used to gauge the delay that
       synchronous_commit level
       remote_apply incurred while committing if this
       server was configured as a synchronous standby.


       sync_priority integer


       Priority of this standby server for being chosen as the
       synchronous standby in a priority-based synchronous replication.
       This has no effect in a quorum-based synchronous replication.


       sync_state text


       Synchronous state of this standby server.
       Possible values are:


-


          async: This standby server is asynchronous.


-


          potential: This standby server is now asynchronous,
          but can potentially become synchronous if one of current
          synchronous ones fails.


-


          sync: This standby server is synchronous.


-


          quorum: This standby server is considered as a candidate
          for quorum standbys.


       reply_time timestamp with time zone


       Send time of last reply message received from standby server


   The lag times reported in the pg_stat_replication
   view are measurements of the time taken for recent WAL to be written,
   flushed and replayed and for the sender to know about it.  These times
   represent the commit delay that was (or would have been) introduced by each
   synchronous commit level, if the remote server was configured as a
   synchronous standby.  For an asynchronous standby, the
   replay_lag column approximates the delay
   before recent transactions became visible to queries.  If the standby
   server has entirely caught up with the sending server and there is no more
   WAL activity, the most recently measured lag times will continue to be
   displayed for a short time and then show NULL.


   Lag times work automatically for physical replication. Logical decoding
   plugins may optionally emit tracking messages; if they do not, the tracking
   mechanism will simply display NULL lag.


    The reported lag times are not predictions of how long it will take for
    the standby to catch up with the sending server assuming the current
    rate of replay.  Such a system would show similar times while new WAL is
    being generated, but would differ when the sender becomes idle.  In
    particular, when the standby has caught up completely,
    pg_stat_replication shows the time taken to
    write, flush and replay the most recent reported WAL location rather than
    zero as some users might expect.  This is consistent with the goal of
    measuring synchronous commit and transaction visibility delays for
    recent write transactions.
    To reduce confusion for users expecting a different model of lag, the
    lag columns revert to NULL after a short time on a fully replayed idle
    system. Monitoring systems should choose whether to represent this
    as missing data, zero or continue to display the last known value.


## pg_stat_replication_slots


   pg_stat_replication_slots


   The pg_stat_replication_slots view will contain
   one row per logical replication slot, showing statistics about its usage.


## pg_stat_replication_slots View


        Column Type


        Description


        slot_name text


        A unique, cluster-wide identifier for the replication slot


        spill_txns bigint


        Number of transactions spilled to disk once the memory used by
        logical decoding to decode changes from WAL has exceeded
        logical_decoding_work_mem. The counter gets
        incremented for both top-level transactions and subtransactions.


        spill_count bigint


        Number of times transactions were spilled to disk while decoding
        changes from WAL for this slot. This counter is incremented each time
        a transaction is spilled, and the same transaction may be spilled
        multiple times.


        spill_bytes bigint


        Amount of decoded transaction data spilled to disk while performing
        decoding of changes from WAL for this slot. This and other spill
        counters can be used to gauge the I/O which occurred during logical
        decoding and allow tuning logical_decoding_work_mem.


        stream_txns bigint


        Number of in-progress transactions streamed to the decoding output
        plugin after the memory used by logical decoding to decode changes
        from WAL for this slot has exceeded
        logical_decoding_work_mem. Streaming only
        works with top-level transactions (subtransactions can't be streamed
        independently), so the counter is not incremented for subtransactions.


        stream_countbigint


        Number of times in-progress transactions were streamed to the decoding
        output plugin while decoding changes from WAL for this slot. This
        counter is incremented each time a transaction is streamed, and the
        same transaction may be streamed multiple times.


        stream_bytesbigint


        Amount of transaction data decoded for streaming in-progress
        transactions to the decoding output plugin while decoding changes from
        WAL for this slot. This and other streaming counters for this slot can
        be used to tune logical_decoding_work_mem.


        mem_exceeded_countbigint


        Number of times the memory used by logical decoding has exceeded
        logical_decoding_work_mem.


        total_txns bigint


        Number of decoded transactions sent to the decoding output plugin for
        this slot. This counts top-level transactions only, and is not incremented
        for subtransactions. Note that this includes the transactions that are
        streamed and/or spilled.


        total_bytesbigint


        Amount of transaction data decoded for sending transactions to the
        decoding output plugin while decoding changes from WAL for this slot.
        Note that this includes data that is streamed and/or spilled.


        slotsync_skip_countbigint


        Number of times the slot synchronization is skipped. Slot
        synchronization occurs only on standby servers and thus this column has
        no meaning on the primary server.


        slotsync_last_skiptimestamp with time zone


        Time at which last slot synchronization was skipped. Slot
        synchronization occurs only on standby servers and thus this column has
        no meaning on the primary server.


        stats_reset timestamp with time zone


        Time at which these statistics were last reset


## pg_stat_wal_receiver

       count (e.g., confl_*).


       sync_seq_error_count bigint


       Number of times an error occurred in the sequence synchronization
       worker. A single worker synchronizes all sequences, so one error
       increment may represent failures across multiple sequences.


       sync_table_error_count bigint


       Number of times an error occurred during the initial table
       synchronization


       confl_insert_exists bigint

## pg_stat_ssl


   pg_stat_ssl


   The pg_stat_ssl view will contain one row per
   backend or WAL sender process, showing statistics about SSL usage on
   this connection. It can be joined to pg_stat_activity
   or pg_stat_replication on the
   pid column to get more details about the
   connection.

       Name of SSL cipher in use, or NULL if SSL is not in use
       on this connection


       bits integer


       Number of bits in the encryption algorithm used, or NULL
       if SSL is not used on this connection


       client_dn text


       Distinguished Name (DN) field from the client certificate
       used, or NULL if no client certificate was supplied or if SSL
       is not in use on this connection. This field is truncated if the
       DN field is longer than NAMEDATALEN (64 characters
       in a standard build).


       client_serial numeric


       Serial number of the client certificate, or NULL if no client
       certificate was supplied or if SSL is not in use on this connection.  The
       combination of certificate serial number and certificate issuer uniquely
       identifies a certificate (unless the issuer erroneously reuses serial
       numbers).


       issuer_dn text


       DN of the issuer of the client certificate, or NULL if no client
       certificate was supplied or if SSL is not in use on this connection.
       This field is truncated like client_dn.


## pg_stat_gssapi


   pg_stat_gssapi


   The pg_stat_gssapi view will contain one row per
   backend, showing information about GSSAPI usage on this connection. It can
   be joined to pg_stat_activity or
   pg_stat_replication on the
   pid column to get more details about the
   connection.


## pg_stat_gssapi View


       Column Type

       Process ID of a backend


       gss_authenticated boolean


       True if GSSAPI authentication was used for this connection


       principal text


       Principal used to authenticate this connection, or NULL
       if GSSAPI was not used to authenticate this connection.  This
       field is truncated if the principal is longer than

## pg_stat_archiver


   pg_stat_archiver


   The pg_stat_archiver view will always have a
   single row, containing data about the archiver process of the cluster.


## pg_stat_archiver View


       Column Type


       Description

       Time of the most recent failed archival operation


       stats_reset timestamp with time zone


       Time at which these statistics were last reset


    Normally, WAL files are archived in order, oldest to newest, but that is
    not guaranteed, and does not hold under special circumstances like when
    promoting a standby or after crash recovery. Therefore it is not safe to
    assume that all files older than
    last_archived_wal have also been successfully
    archived.


## pg_stat_io


   pg_stat_io


   The pg_stat_io view will contain one row for each
   combination of backend type, target I/O object, and I/O context, showing
   cluster-wide I/O statistics. Combinations which do not make sense are
   omitted.


   Currently, I/O on relations (e.g. tables, indexes) and WAL activity are
   tracked. However, relation I/O which bypasses shared buffers
   (e.g. when moving a table from one tablespace to another) is currently
   not tracked.


## pg_stat_io View


        Column Type


        Description


        backend_type text


        Type of backend (e.g. background worker, autovacuum worker). See
        pg_stat_activity for more information
        on backend_types. Some
        backend_types do not accumulate I/O operation
        statistics and will not be included in the view.


        object text


        Target object of an I/O operation. Possible values are:


-


          relation: Permanent relations.


-


          temp relation: Temporary relations.


-


          wal: Write Ahead Logs.


        context text


        The context of an I/O operation. Possible values are:


-


          normal: The default or standard
          context for a type of I/O operation. For
          example, by default, relation data is read into and written out from
          shared buffers. Thus, reads and writes of relation data to and from
          shared buffers are tracked in context
          normal.


-


          init: I/O operations performed while creating the
          WAL segments are tracked in context
          init.


-


          vacuum: I/O operations performed outside of shared
          buffers while vacuuming and analyzing permanent relations. Temporary
          table vacuums use the same local buffer pool as other temporary table
          I/O operations and are tracked in context
          normal.


-


          bulkread: Certain large read I/O operations
          done outside of shared buffers, for example, a sequential scan of a
          large table.


-


          bulkwrite: Certain large write I/O operations
          done outside of shared buffers, such as COPY.


        reads bigint


        Number of read operations.


        read_bytes numeric


        The total size of read operations in bytes.


        read_time double precision


        Time spent waiting for read operations in milliseconds (if
         is enabled and
        object is not wal,
        or if  is enabled
        and object is wal,
        otherwise zero). This may include time spent waiting for a
        read started by another backend. In that case
        reads may still be zero.


        writes bigint


        Number of write operations.


        write_bytes numeric


        The total size of write operations in bytes.


        write_time double precision


        Time spent waiting for write operations in milliseconds (if
         is enabled and
        object is not wal,
        or if  is enabled
        and object is wal,
        otherwise zero)


        writebacks bigint


        Number of units of size BLCKSZ (typically 8kB) which
        the process requested the kernel write out to permanent storage.


        writeback_time double precision


        Time spent waiting for writeback operations in milliseconds (if
         is enabled, otherwise zero). This
        includes the time spent queueing write-out requests and, potentially,
        the time spent to write out the dirty data.


        extends bigint


        Number of relation extend operations.


        extend_bytes numeric


        The total size of relation extend operations in bytes.


        extend_time double precision


        Time spent waiting for extend operations in milliseconds. (if
         is enabled and
        object is not wal,
        or if  is enabled
        and object is wal,
        otherwise zero)


        hits bigint


        The number of times a desired block was found in a shared buffer.


        evictions bigint


        Number of times a block has been written out from a shared or local
        buffer in order to make it available for another use.


        In context normal, this counts
        the number of times a block was evicted from a buffer and replaced with
        another block. In contexts
        bulkwrite, bulkread, and
        vacuum, this counts the number of times a block was
        evicted from shared buffers in order to add the shared buffer to a
        separate, size-limited ring buffer for use in a bulk I/O operation.


        reuses bigint


        The number of times an existing buffer in a size-limited ring buffer
        outside of shared buffers was reused as part of an I/O operation in the
        bulkread, bulkwrite, or
        vacuum contexts.


        fsyncs bigint


        Number of fsync calls. These are only tracked in
        context normal.


        fsync_time double precision


        Time spent waiting for fsync operations in milliseconds (if
         is enabled and
        object is not wal,
        or if  is enabled
        and object is wal,
        otherwise zero)


        stats_reset timestamp with time zone


        Time at which these statistics were last reset.


   Some backend types never perform I/O operations on some I/O objects and/or
   in some I/O contexts. These rows are omitted from the view. For example, the
   checkpointer does not checkpoint temporary tables, so there will be no rows
   for backend_type checkpointer and
   object temp relation.


   In addition, some I/O operations will never be performed either by certain
   backend types or on certain I/O objects and/or in certain I/O contexts.
   These cells will be NULL. For example, temporary tables are not
   fsynced, so fsyncs will be NULL for
   object temp relation. Also, the
   background writer does not perform reads, so reads will
   be NULL in rows for backend_type background
   writer.


   For the object wal,
   fsyncs and fsync_time track the
   fsync activity of WAL files done in issue_xlog_fsync.
   writes and write_time
   track the write activity of WAL files done in
   XLogWrite.
   See  for more information.


   pg_stat_io can be used to inform database tuning.
   For example:


-


      A high evictions count can indicate that shared
      buffers should be increased.


-


      Client backends rely on the checkpointer to ensure data is persisted to
      permanent storage. Large numbers of fsyncs by
      client backends could indicate a misconfiguration of
      shared buffers or of the checkpointer. More information on configuring
      the checkpointer can be found in .


-


      Normally, client backends should be able to rely on auxiliary processes
      like the checkpointer and the background writer to write out dirty data
      as much as possible. Large numbers of writes by client backends could
      indicate a misconfiguration of shared buffers or of the checkpointer.
      More information on configuring the checkpointer can be found in .


    Columns tracking I/O wait time will only be non-zero when
     is enabled. The user should be
    careful when referencing these columns in combination with their
    corresponding I/O operations in case track_io_timing
    was not enabled for the entire time since the last stats reset.

   pg_stat_autovacuum_scores


   The pg_stat_autovacuum_scores view will contain one
   row for each table in the current database (including TOAST tables), showing
   the current autovacuum scores for that specific table.  Autovacuum
   prioritizes tables deemed eligible for processing based on their
   score, with higher scores indicating higher
   priority.  See  for more information.


   While this view generates its results the same way that autovacuum workers
   do, it does so using the current source information, which might differ from
   the source information that an autovacuum worker sees when it gathers its
   list of tables to process.  Therefore, this view is not a completely
   reliable indicator of which tables autovacuum will process and what order it
   will process them.


## pg_stat_autovacuum_scores View


       Column Type


       Description


       relid oid


       Oid of the table.

       autovacuum would use to sort the list of tables to process.


       xid_score double precision

        indicate that
       autovacuum would vacuum the table for transaction ID wraparound
       prevention.


       mxid_score double precision


       Multixact ID age component score.  Scores greater than
        indicate
       that autovacuum would vacuum the table for multixact ID wraparound
       prevention.


       vacuum_score double precision


       Vacuum component score.  Scores greater than
        indicate that
       autovacuum would vacuum the table (unless autovacuum is disabled).


       vacuum_insert_score double precision

        indicate that
       autovacuum would analyze the table (unless autovacuum is disabled).


       do_vacuum bool


       Whether autovacuum would vacuum the table.  Note that even if the
       component scores indicate that autovacuum would vacuum the table, this
       may be false if autovacuum is disabled.


       do_analyze bool


       Whether autovacuum would analyze the table.  Note that even if the
       component scores indicate that autovacuum would analyze the table, this
       may be false if autovacuum is disabled.

   showing statistics about accesses to that specific index. The
   pg_stat_user_indexes and
   pg_stat_sys_indexes views
   contain the same information,
   but filtered to only show user and system indexes respectively.


## pg_stat_all_indexes View


       Column Type


       Description


       relid oid


       OID of the table for this index


       indexrelid oid

       Number of index scans initiated on this index


       last_idx_scan timestamp with time zone


       The time of the last scan on this index, based on the
       most recent transaction stop time


       idx_tup_read bigint


       Number of index entries returned by scans on this index


       idx_tup_fetch bigint


       Number of live table rows fetched by simple index scans using this
       index


        stats_reset timestamp with time zone


        Time at which these statistics were last reset


   Indexes can be used by simple index scans, bitmap index scans,
   and the optimizer.  In a bitmap scan
   the output of several indexes can be combined via AND or OR rules,
   so it is difficult to associate individual heap row fetches
   with specific indexes when a bitmap scan is used.  Therefore, a bitmap
   scan increments the
   pg_stat_all_indexes.idx_tup_read
   count(s) for the index(es) it uses, and it increments the
   pg_stat_all_tables.idx_tup_fetch
   count for the table, but it does not affect
   pg_stat_all_indexes.idx_tup_fetch.
   The optimizer also accesses indexes to check for supplied constants
   whose values are outside the recorded range of the optimizer statistics
   because the optimizer statistics might be stale.


    The idx_tup_read and idx_tup_fetch counts
    can be different even without any use of bitmap scans,
    because idx_tup_read counts
    index entries retrieved from the index while idx_tup_fetch
    counts live rows fetched from the table.  The latter will be less if any
    dead or not-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index, or if any
    heap fetches are avoided by means of an index-only scan.


    Index scans may sometimes perform multiple index searches per execution.
    Each index search increments pg_stat_all_indexes.idx_scan,
    so it's possible for the count of index scans to significantly exceed the
    total number of index scan executor node executions.


    This can happen with queries that use certain SQL
    constructs to search for rows matching any value out of a list or array of
    multiple scalar values (see ).  It
    can also happen to queries with a
    column_name =
     value1 OR
     column_name =
     value2 ... construct, though only
    when the optimizer transforms the construct into an equivalent
    multi-valued array representation.  Similarly, when B-tree index scans use
    the skip scan optimization, an index search is performed each time the
    scan is repositioned to the next index leaf page that might have matching
    tuples (see ).


    EXPLAIN ANALYZE outputs the total number of index
    searches performed by each index scan node.  See
     for an example demonstrating how
    this works.

## Statistics Functions


   Other ways of looking at the statistics can be set up by writing
   queries that use the same underlying statistics access functions used by
   the standard views shown above.  For details such as the functions' names,
   consult the definitions of the standard views.  (For example, in
   psql you could issue \d+ pg_stat_activity.)
   The access functions for per-database statistics take a database OID as an
   argument to identify which database to report on.
   The per-table and per-index functions take a table or index OID.
   The functions for per-function statistics take a function OID.
   Note that only tables, indexes, and functions in the current database
   can be seen with these functions.


   Additional functions related to the cumulative statistics system are listed
   in .

        stats_fetch_consistency is set to
        snapshot


         pg_stat_reset_single_index_counters

        pg_stat_reset_single_index_counters ( oid )
        void


        Resets statistics for a single index in the current database
        or shared across all databases in the cluster to zero.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


         pg_stat_get_xact_blocks_fetched

        pg_stat_get_xact_blocks_fetched ( oid )
        bigint


        Returns the number of block read requests for table or index, in the
        current transaction. This number minus
        pg_stat_get_xact_blocks_hit gives the number of
        kernel read() calls; the number of actual
        physical reads is usually lower due to kernel-level buffering.


         pg_stat_get_xact_blocks_hit

        pg_stat_get_xact_blocks_hit ( oid )
        bigint


        Returns the number of block read requests for table or index, in the
        current transaction, found in cache (not triggering kernel
        read() calls).


         pg_stat_clear_snapshot

        pg_stat_clear_snapshot ()
        void

        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


         pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters

        pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters ( oid )
        void


        Resets statistics for a single table in the current database
        or shared across all databases in the cluster to zero.
        It also resets statistics for a single sequence or materialized view
        in the current database.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


         pg_stat_reset_backend_stats

        pg_stat_reset_backend_stats ( integer )
        void


        Resets statistics for a single backend with the specified process ID
        to zero.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


         pg_stat_reset_single_function_counters

        pg_stat_reset_single_function_counters ( oid )
        void


        Resets statistics for a single function in the current database to
        zero.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


         pg_stat_reset_slru

        pg_stat_reset_slru ( [

target

 text DEFAULT NULL ] )
        void


        Resets statistics to zero for a single SLRU cache, or for all SLRUs in
        the cluster. If

target

 is
        NULL or is not specified, all the counters shown in
        the pg_stat_slru view for all SLRU caches are
        reset. The argument can be one of
        commit_timestamp,
        multixact_member,
        multixact_offset,
        notify,
        serializable,
        subtransaction, or
        transaction
        to reset the counters for only that entry.
        If the argument is other (or indeed, any
        unrecognized name), then the counters for all other SLRU caches, such
        as extension-defined caches, are reset.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


          pg_stat_reset_replication_slot

        pg_stat_reset_replication_slot ( text )
        void


        Resets statistics of the replication slot defined by the argument. If
        the argument is NULL, resets statistics for all
        the replication slots.


         This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
         can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


          pg_stat_reset_subscription_stats

        pg_stat_reset_subscription_stats ( oid )
        void


        Resets statistics for a single subscription shown in the
        pg_stat_subscription_stats view to zero. If
        the argument is NULL, reset statistics for all
        subscriptions.


        This function is restricted to superusers by default, but other users
        can be granted EXECUTE to run the function.


    Using pg_stat_reset() also resets counters that
    autovacuum uses to determine when to trigger a vacuum or an analyze.
    Resetting these counters can cause autovacuum to not perform necessary
    work, which can cause problems such as table bloat or out-dated
    table statistics.  A database-wide ANALYZE is
    recommended after the statistics have been reset.


   pg_stat_get_activity, the underlying function of
   the pg_stat_activity view, returns a set of records
   containing all the available information about each backend process.
   Sometimes it may be more convenient to obtain just a subset of this
   information.  In such cases, another set of per-backend statistics
   access functions can be used; these are shown in .
   These access functions use the session's backend ID number, which is a
   small integer (>= 0) that is distinct from the backend ID of any
   concurrent session, although a session's ID can be recycled as soon as
   it exits.  The backend ID is used, among other things, to identify the
   session's temporary schema if it has one.
   The function pg_stat_get_backend_idset provides a
   convenient way to list all the active backends' ID numbers for
   invoking these functions.  For example, to show the PIDs and
   current queries of all backends:


```
SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_pid(backendid) AS pid,
       pg_stat_get_backend_activity(backendid) AS query
FROM pg_stat_get_backend_idset() AS backendid;
```

## Viewing Locks


   lock
   monitoring


   Another useful tool for monitoring database activity is the
   pg_locks system table.  It allows the
   database administrator to view information about the outstanding
   locks in the lock manager. For example, this capability can be used
   to:


-


      View all the locks currently outstanding, all the locks on
      relations in a particular database, all the locks on a
      particular relation, or all the locks held by a particular
      PostgreSQL session.


-


      Determine the relation in the current database with the most
      ungranted locks (which might be a source of contention among
      database clients).


-


      Determine the effect of lock contention on overall database
      performance, as well as the extent to which contention varies
      with overall database traffic.


   Details of the pg_locks view appear in
   .
   For more information on locking and managing concurrency with
   PostgreSQL, refer to .


## Progress Reporting


   PostgreSQL has the ability to report the progress of
   certain commands during command execution.  Currently, the only commands
   which support progress reporting are ANALYZE,
   COPY, CREATE INDEX,
   REPACK (and its obsolete spelling CLUSTER),
   VACUUM,
    (i.e., replication
   command that  issues to take
   a base backup), and online data checksum operations.
   This may be expanded in the future.


## ANALYZE Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_analyze


   Whenever ANALYZE is running, the
   pg_stat_progress_analyze view will contain a
   row for each backend that is currently running that command.  The tables
   below describe the information that will be reported and provide
   information about how to interpret it.


## pg_stat_progress_analyze View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of backend.


       datid oid

       when the phase is computing extended statistics.


       child_tables_total bigint


       Number of child tables.


       child_tables_done bigint

       phase is acquiring inherited sample rows.


       current_child_table_relid oid


       OID of the child table currently being scanned. This field is
       only valid when the phase is
       acquiring inherited sample rows.


       delay_time double precision


       Total time spent sleeping due to cost-based delay (see
       ), in milliseconds
       (if  is enabled, otherwise
       zero).


       started_by text


       Shows what caused the current ANALYZE operation to be
       started. Possible values are:


-


          manual: The analyze was started by an explicit
          ANALYZE, or by VACUUM with
          the ANALYZE option.


-


          autovacuum: The analyze was started by an
          autovacuum worker.


## ANALYZE Phases


      Phase
      Description


      initializing

       The command is preparing to begin scanning the heap.  This phase is
       expected to be very brief.


      acquiring sample rows

       The command is currently scanning the table given by
       relid to obtain sample rows.


      acquiring inherited sample rows

       The command is currently scanning child tables to obtain sample rows.
       Columns child_tables_total,
       child_tables_done, and
       current_child_table_relid contain the
       progress information for this phase.


      computing statistics

       The command is computing statistics from the sample rows obtained
       during the table scan.


      computing extended statistics

       The command is computing extended statistics from the sample rows
       obtained during the table scan.


      finalizing analyze

       The command is updating pg_class. When this
       phase is completed, ANALYZE will end.


    Note that when ANALYZE is run on a partitioned table
    without the ONLY keyword, all of its partitions are
    also recursively analyzed.  In that case, ANALYZE
    progress is reported first for the parent table, whereby its inheritance
    statistics are collected, followed by that for each partition.


## CLUSTER Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_cluster


   Whenever REPACK, CLUSTER or
   VACUUM FULL is running,
   the backwards-compatibility pg_stat_progress_cluster
   view will
   contain a row for each backend that is currently running either command.
   The tables below describe the information that will be reported and
   provide information about how to interpret it.


## pg_stat_progress_cluster View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of backend.


       datid oid


       OID of the database to which this backend is connected.

       OID of the table being clustered.


       command text


       The command that is running. Either CLUSTER or
       VACUUM FULL.
       Because this view exists for backwards-compatibility purposes only,
       it will translate any REPACK command into one of
       these other two.


       phase text


       Current processing phase. See .


       cluster_index_relid oid


       If the table is being scanned using an index, this is the OID of the
       index being used; otherwise, it is zero.


       heap_tuples_scanned bigint


       Number of heap tuples scanned.
       This counter only advances when the phase is
       seq scanning heap,
       index scanning heap
       or writing new heap.


       heap_tuples_written bigint


       Number of heap tuples written.
       This counter only advances when the phase is
       seq scanning heap,
       index scanning heap
       or writing new heap.


       heap_blks_total bigint


       Total number of heap blocks in the table.  This number is reported
       as of the beginning of seq scanning heap.


       heap_blks_scanned bigint


       Number of heap blocks scanned.  This counter only advances when the
       phase is seq scanning heap.


       index_rebuild_count bigint


       Number of indexes rebuilt.  This counter only advances when the phase
       is rebuilding index.


## CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL Phases


      Phase
      Description


     initializing

       The command is preparing to begin scanning the heap.  This phase is
       expected to be very brief.


     seq scanning heap

       The command is currently scanning the table using a sequential scan.


     index scanning heap

       CLUSTER is currently scanning the table using an index scan.


     sorting tuples

       CLUSTER is currently sorting tuples.


     writing new heap

       CLUSTER is currently writing the new heap.


     swapping relation files

       The command is currently swapping newly-built files into place.


     rebuilding index

       The command is currently rebuilding an index.


     performing final cleanup

       The command is performing final cleanup.  When this phase is
       completed, CLUSTER
       or VACUUM FULL will end.


## COPY Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_copy


   Whenever COPY is running, the
   pg_stat_progress_copy view will contain one row

       FILE, PROGRAM,
       PIPE (for COPY FROM STDIN and
       COPY TO STDOUT), or CALLBACK
       (used for example during the initial table synchronization in
       logical replication).


       bytes_processed bigint


       Number of bytes already processed by COPY command.


       bytes_total bigint


       Size of source file for COPY FROM command in bytes.

## CREATE INDEX Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_create_index


   Whenever CREATE INDEX or REINDEX is running, the
   pg_stat_progress_create_index view will contain
   one row for each backend that is currently creating indexes.  The tables
   below describe the information that will be reported and provide information
   about how to interpret it.

## CREATE INDEX Phases


      Phase
      Description


      initializing

       CREATE INDEX or REINDEX is preparing to create the index.  This
       phase is expected to be very brief.


      waiting for writers before build

       CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY or REINDEX CONCURRENTLY is waiting for transactions
       with write locks that can potentially see the table to finish.
       This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode.
       Columns lockers_total, lockers_done
       and current_locker_pid contain the progress
       information for this phase.


      building index

       The index is being built by the access method-specific code.  In this phase,
       access methods that support progress reporting fill in their own progress data,
       and the subphase is indicated in this column.  Typically,
       blocks_total and blocks_done
       will contain progress data, as well as potentially
       tuples_total and tuples_done.


      waiting for writers before validation

## REPACK Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_repack


   Whenever REPACK is running,
   the pg_stat_progress_repack view will contain a
   row for each backend that is currently running the command.  The tables
   below describe the information that will be reported and provide
   information about how to interpret it.


## pg_stat_progress_repack View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of backend.


       datid oid


       OID of the database to which this backend is connected.


       datname name


       Name of the database to which this backend is connected.


       relid oid

       command text


       The command that is running. Either REPACK or
       VACUUM FULL, or CLUSTER.


       phase text


       Current processing phase. See .


       repack_index_relid oid


       If the table is being scanned using an index, this is the OID of the
       index being used; otherwise, it is zero.


       heap_tuples_scanned bigint


       Number of heap tuples scanned.
       This counter only advances when the phase is
       seq scanning heap,
       index scanning heap
       or writing new heap.


       heap_tuples_inserted bigint


       Number of heap tuples inserted.
       This counter only advances when the phase is
       seq scanning heap,
       index scanning heap,
       writing new heap
       or catch-up.


       heap_tuples_updated bigint


       Number of heap tuples updated.
       This counter only advances when the phase is catch-up.


       heap_tuples_deleted bigint


       Number of heap tuples deleted.
       This counter only advances when the phase is catch-up.


       heap_blks_total bigint

       as of the beginning of seq scanning heap.


       heap_blks_scanned bigint


       Number of heap blocks scanned.  This counter only advances when the
       phase is seq scanning heap.


       index_rebuild_count bigint


       Number of indexes rebuilt.  This counter only advances when the phase
       is rebuilding index.


## REPACK Phases


      Phase
      Description


     initializing

       The command is preparing to begin scanning the heap.  This phase is
       expected to be very brief.


     seq scanning heap

       The command is currently scanning the table using a sequential scan.


     index scanning heap

       REPACK is currently scanning the table using an index scan.


     sorting tuples

       REPACK is currently sorting tuples.


     writing new heap

       REPACK is currently writing the new heap.


     catch-up

       completed, REPACK will end.


## VACUUM Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_vacuum


   Whenever VACUUM is running, the
   pg_stat_progress_vacuum view will contain
   one row for each backend (including autovacuum worker processes) that is
   currently vacuuming.  The tables below describe the information
   that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.
   Progress for VACUUM FULL commands is reported via
   pg_stat_progress_cluster
   because both VACUUM FULL and CLUSTER
   rewrite the table, while regular VACUUM only modifies it
   in place. See .


## pg_stat_progress_vacuum View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of backend.


       datid oid


       OID of the database to which this backend is connected.


       datname name


       Name of the database to which this backend is connected.


       relid oid


       OID of the table being vacuumed.


       phase text


       Current processing phase of vacuum.  See .


       heap_blks_total bigint


       Total number of heap blocks in the table.  This number is reported
       as of the beginning of the scan; blocks added later will not be (and
       need not be) visited by this VACUUM.


       heap_blks_scanned bigint


       Number of heap blocks scanned.  Because the
       visibility map is used to optimize scans,
       some blocks will be skipped without inspection; skipped blocks are
       included in this total, so that this number will eventually become
       equal to heap_blks_total when the vacuum is complete.
       This counter only advances when the phase is scanning heap.


       heap_blks_vacuumed bigint


       Number of heap blocks vacuumed.  Unless the table has no indexes, this
       counter only advances when the phase is vacuuming heap.
       Blocks that contain no dead tuples are skipped, so the counter may
       sometimes skip forward in large increments.


       index_vacuum_count bigint


       Number of completed index vacuum cycles.


       max_dead_tuple_bytes bigint


       Amount of dead tuple data that we can store before needing to perform
       an index vacuum cycle, based on
       .


       dead_tuple_bytes bigint


       Amount of dead tuple data collected since the last index vacuum cycle.


      num_dead_item_ids bigint


       Number of dead item identifiers collected since the last index vacuum cycle.


       indexes_total bigint


       Total number of indexes that will be vacuumed or cleaned up. This
       number is reported at the beginning of the
       vacuuming indexes phase or the
       cleaning up indexes phase.


       indexes_processed bigint


       Number of indexes processed. This counter only advances when the
       phase is vacuuming indexes or
       cleaning up indexes.


       delay_time double precision


       Total time spent sleeping due to cost-based delay (see
       ), in milliseconds
       (if  is enabled, otherwise
       zero).  This includes the time that any associated parallel workers have
       slept.  However, parallel workers report their sleep time no more
       frequently than once per second, so the reported value may be slightly
       stale.


       mode text


       The mode in which the current VACUUM operation is
       running. See  for details of each
       mode. Possible values are:


-


          normal: The operation is performing a standard
          vacuum. It is neither required to run in aggressive mode nor operating
          in failsafe mode.


-


          aggressive: The operation is running an aggressive
          vacuum, which must scan every page that is not marked all-frozen.
          The parameters  and
           determine when a
          table requires aggressive vacuuming.


-


          failsafe: The vacuum has entered failsafe mode,
          in which it performs only the minimum work necessary to avoid
          transaction ID or multixact ID wraparound failure.
          The parameters  and
           determine when the
          vacuum enters failsafe mode. The vacuum may start in this mode or
          switch to it while running; the value of the
          mode column may transition from another
          mode to failsafe during the operation.


       started_by text


       Shows what caused the current VACUUM operation to be
       started. Possible values are:


-


          manual: The vacuum was started by an explicit
          VACUUM command.


-


          autovacuum: The vacuum was started by an autovacuum
          worker. Vacuums run by autovacuum workers may be interrupted due to
          lock conflicts.


-


          autovacuum_wraparound: The vacuum was started by an
          autovacuum worker to prevent transaction ID or multixact ID
          wraparound. Vacuums run for wraparound protection are not interrupted
          due to lock conflicts.


## VACUUM Phases


      Phase
      Description


     initializing

       VACUUM is preparing to begin scanning the heap.  This
       phase is expected to be very brief.


     scanning heap

       VACUUM is currently scanning the heap.  It will prune and
       defragment each page if required, and possibly perform freezing
       activity.  The heap_blks_scanned column can be used
       to monitor the progress of the scan.


     vacuuming indexes

       VACUUM is currently vacuuming the indexes.  If a table has
       any indexes, this will happen at least once per vacuum, after the heap
       has been completely scanned.  It may happen multiple times per vacuum
       if  (or, in the case of autovacuum,
        if set) is insufficient to store
       the number of dead tuples found.


     vacuuming heap

       VACUUM is currently vacuuming the heap.  Vacuuming the heap
       is distinct from scanning the heap, and occurs after each instance of
       vacuuming indexes.  If heap_blks_scanned is less than
       heap_blks_total, the system will return to scanning
       the heap after this phase is completed; otherwise, it will begin
       cleaning up indexes after this phase is completed.


     cleaning up indexes

       VACUUM is currently cleaning up indexes.  This occurs after
       the heap has been completely scanned and all vacuuming of the indexes
       and the heap has been completed.


     truncating heap

       VACUUM is currently truncating the heap so as to return
       empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system.  This
       occurs after cleaning up indexes.


     performing final cleanup

       VACUUM is performing final cleanup.  During this phase,
       VACUUM will vacuum the free space map, update statistics
       in pg_class, and report statistics to the cumulative
       statistics system. When this phase is completed, VACUUM will end.


## Base Backup Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_basebackup


   Whenever an application like pg_basebackup
   is taking a base backup, the
   pg_stat_progress_basebackup
   view will contain a row for each WAL sender process that is currently
   running the BASE_BACKUP replication command
   and streaming the backup. The tables below describe the information
   that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.


## pg_stat_progress_basebackup View


       Column Type


       Description


       pid integer


       Process ID of a WAL sender process.


       phase text


       Current processing phase. See .


       backup_total bigint


       Total amount of data that will be streamed. This is estimated and
       reported as of the beginning of
       streaming database files phase. Note that
       this is only an approximation since the database
       may change during streaming database files phase
       and WAL log may be included in the backup later. This is always
       the same value as backup_streamed
       once the amount of data streamed exceeds the estimated
       total size. If the estimation is disabled in
       pg_basebackup
       (i.e., --no-estimate-size option is specified),
       this is NULL.


       backup_streamed bigint


       Amount of data streamed. This counter only advances
       when the phase is streaming database files or
       transferring wal files.


       tablespaces_total bigint


       Total number of tablespaces that will be streamed.


       tablespaces_streamed bigint


       Number of tablespaces streamed. This counter only
       advances when the phase is streaming database files.


       backup_type text


        Backup type. Either full or
        incremental.


## Base Backup Phases


      Phase
      Description


      initializing

       The WAL sender process is preparing to begin the backup.
       This phase is expected to be very brief.


      waiting for checkpoint to finish

       The WAL sender process is currently performing
       pg_backup_start to prepare to
       take a base backup, and waiting for the start-of-backup
       checkpoint to finish.


      estimating backup size

       The WAL sender process is currently estimating the total amount
       of database files that will be streamed as a base backup.


      streaming database files

       The WAL sender process is currently streaming database files
       as a base backup.


      waiting for wal archiving to finish

       The WAL sender process is currently performing
       pg_backup_stop to finish the backup,
       and waiting for all the WAL files required for the base backup
       to be successfully archived.
       If either --wal-method=none or
       --wal-method=stream is specified in
       pg_basebackup, the backup will end
       when this phase is completed.


      transferring wal files

       The WAL sender process is currently transferring all WAL logs
       generated during the backup. This phase occurs after
       waiting for wal archiving to finish phase if
       --wal-method=fetch is specified in
       pg_basebackup. The backup will end
       when this phase is completed.


## Data Checksum Progress Reporting


   pg_stat_progress_data_checksums


   When data checksums are being enabled or disabled on a running cluster, the
   pg_stat_progress_data_checksums view will contain
   a row for the launcher process.  When enabling data checksums, the view
   will also contain one row for each worker process which is currently
   calculating and writing checksums for the data pages in a database.  The
   launcher provides an overview of the overall progress, such as how many
   databases have been processed and how many remain, while the workers track
   progress for currently processed databases.


## pg_stat_progress_data_checksums View


        Column Type


        Description


        pid integer


        Process ID of the data checksum process, launcher or worker.


        datid oid


        OID of this database, or 0 for the launcher process.


        datname name


        Name of this database, or NULL for the
        launcher process.


        phase text


        Current processing phase, see
        for description of the phases.


        databases_total bigint


        The total number of databases which will be processed. Only the
        launcher process has this value set when enabling data checksums;
        otherwise this is set to NULL.


        databases_done bigint


        The number of databases which have been processed. Only the launcher
        process has this value set when enabling data checksums; otherwise
        this is set to NULL.


        relations_total bigint


        The total number of relations which will be processed, or
        NULL if the worker process hasn't
        calculated the number of relations yet. The launcher process has
        this set to NULL since it isn't responsible for
        processing relations, only launching worker processes.


        relations_done bigint


        The number of relations which have been processed. The launcher
        process has this set to NULL.


        blocks_total bigint


        The number of blocks in the current relation which will be processed,
        or NULL if the worker process hasn't
        calculated the number of blocks yet. The launcher process has
        this set to NULL.


        blocks_done bigint


        The number of blocks in the current relation which have been processed.
        The launcher process has this set to NULL.


## Data Checksum Phases


      Phase
      Description


      enabling

       The command is currently enabling data checksums on the cluster.


      disabling

       The command is currently disabling data checksums on the cluster.


      done

       The command is done and the data checksum state in the cluster has
       changed.


      waiting on barrier

       The command is currently waiting for the current active backends to
       acknowledge the change in data checksum state.


      waiting on temporary tables

       The command is currently waiting for all temporary tables which existed
       at the time the command was started to be removed.


## Dynamic Tracing


  DTrace


   PostgreSQL provides facilities to support
   dynamic tracing of the database server. This allows an external
   utility to be called at specific points in the code and thereby trace
   execution.


   A number of probes or trace points are already inserted into the source
   code. These probes are intended to be used by database developers and
   administrators. By default the probes are not compiled into
   PostgreSQL; the user needs to explicitly tell
   the configure script to make the probes available.


   Currently, the
   DTrace
   utility is supported, which, at the time of this writing, is available
   on Solaris, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Oracle Linux.  The
   SystemTap project
   for Linux provides a DTrace equivalent and can also be used.  Supporting other dynamic
   tracing utilities is theoretically possible by changing the definitions for
   the macros in src/include/utils/probes.h.


## Compiling for Dynamic Tracing


   By default, probes are not available, so you will need to
   explicitly tell the configure script to make the probes available
   in PostgreSQL. To include DTrace support
   specify --enable-dtrace to configure.  See  for further information.


## Built-in Probes


   A number of standard probes are provided in the source code,
   as shown in ;

   shows the types used in the probes.  More probes can certainly be
   added to enhance PostgreSQL's observability.

      arg0 is the total number of buffers.
      arg1 is the number of buffers actually written by the checkpoint process.
      arg2 is the number that were expected to be written (arg1 of
      buffer-sync-start); any difference reflects other processes flushing
      buffers during the checkpoint.


     buffer-checkpoint-sync-start
     ()
     Probe that fires after dirty buffers have been written to the
      kernel, and before starting to issue fsync requests.

     ()
     Probe that fires when syncing of buffers to disk is
      complete.


     twophase-checkpoint-start
     ()
     Probe that fires when the two-phase portion of a checkpoint is
      started.


     twophase-checkpoint-done
     ()
     Probe that fires when the two-phase portion of a checkpoint is
      complete.

       tablespace, database, and relation OIDs identifying the relation.  arg4
       is the ID of the backend which created the temporary relation for a
       local buffer, or INVALID_PROC_NUMBER (-1) for a shared
       buffer. arg5 is the number of blocks the caller would like to extend
       by.

       is the ID of the backend which created the temporary relation for a
       local buffer, or INVALID_PROC_NUMBER (-1) for a shared
       buffer. arg5 is the number of blocks the relation was extended by, this

## Using Probes


   The example below shows a DTrace script for analyzing transaction
   counts in the system, as an alternative to snapshotting
   pg_stat_database before and after a performance test:


```
#!/usr/sbin/dtrace -qs

postgresql$1:::transaction-start
{
      @start["Start"] = count();
      self->ts  = timestamp;
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-abort
{
      @abort["Abort"] = count();
}

postgresql$1:::transaction-commit
/self->ts/
{
      @commit["Commit"] = count();
      @time["Total time (ns)"] = sum(timestamp - self->ts);
      self->ts=0;
}
```


   When executed, the example D script gives output such as:


```
# ./txn_count.d `pgrep -n postgres` or ./txn_count.d
^C

Start                                          71
Commit                                         70
Total time (ns)                        2312105013
```


    SystemTap uses a different notation for trace scripts than DTrace does,
    even though the underlying trace points are compatible.  One point worth
    noting is that at this writing, SystemTap scripts must reference probe
    names using double underscores in place of hyphens.  This is expected to
    be fixed in future SystemTap releases.


   You should remember that DTrace scripts need to be carefully written and
   debugged, otherwise the trace information collected might
   be meaningless. In most cases where problems are found it is the
   instrumentation that is at fault, not the underlying system. When
   discussing information found using dynamic tracing, be sure to enclose
   the script used to allow that too to be checked and discussed.


## Defining New Probes


   New probes can be defined within the code wherever the developer
   desires, though this will require a recompilation. Below are the steps
   for inserting new probes:


     Decide on probe names and data to be made available through the probes


     Add the probe definitions to src/backend/utils/probes.d


     Include pg_trace.h if it is not already present in the
     module(s) containing the probe points, and insert
     TRACE_POSTGRESQL probe macros at the desired locations
     in the source code


     Recompile and verify that the new probes are available


## Example:


    Here is an example of how you would add a probe to trace all new
    transactions by transaction ID.


     Decide that the probe will be named transaction-start and
     requires a parameter of type LocalTransactionId


     Add the probe definition to src/backend/utils/probes.d:


```
probe transaction__start(LocalTransactionId);
```


     Note the use of the double underline in the probe name. In a DTrace
     script using the probe, the double underline needs to be replaced with a
     hyphen, so transaction-start is the name to document for
     users.


     At compile time, transaction__start is converted to a macro
     called TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START (notice the
     underscores are single here), which is available by including
     pg_trace.h.  Add the macro call to the appropriate location
     in the source code.  In this case, it looks like the following:


```
TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(vxid.localTransactionId);
```


     After recompiling and running the new binary, check that your newly added
     probe is available by executing the following DTrace command.  You
     should see similar output:


```
# dtrace -ln transaction-start
   ID    PROVIDER          MODULE           FUNCTION NAME
18705 postgresql49878     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18755 postgresql49877     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18805 postgresql49876     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18855 postgresql49875     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
18986 postgresql49873     postgres     StartTransactionCommand transaction-start
```


   There are a few things to be careful about when adding trace macros
   to the C code:


-


      You should take care that the data types specified for a probe's
      parameters match the data types of the variables used in the macro.
      Otherwise, you will get compilation errors.


-


      On most platforms, if PostgreSQL is
      built with --enable-dtrace, the arguments to a trace
      macro will be evaluated whenever control passes through the
      macro, even if no tracing is being done.  This is
      usually not worth worrying about if you are just reporting the
      values of a few local variables.  But beware of putting expensive
      function calls into the arguments.  If you need to do that,
      consider protecting the macro with a check to see if the trace
      is actually enabled:


```
if (TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START_ENABLED())
    TRACE_POSTGRESQL_TRANSACTION_START(some_function(...));
```


      Each trace macro has a corresponding ENABLED macro.


## Monitoring Disk Usage


   This section discusses how to monitor the disk usage of a
   PostgreSQL database system.


## Determining Disk Usage


    disk usage


    Each table has a primary heap disk file where most of the data is
    stored. If the table has any columns with potentially-wide values,
    there also might be a TOAST file associated with the table,
    which is used to store values too wide to fit comfortably in the main
    table (see ).  There will be one valid index
    on the TOAST table, if present. There also might be indexes
    associated with the base table.  Each table and index is stored in a
    separate disk file — possibly more than one file, if the file would
    exceed one gigabyte.  Naming conventions for these files are described
    in .


    You can monitor disk space in three ways:
    using the SQL functions listed in ,
    using the  module, or
    using manual inspection of the system catalogs.
    The SQL functions are the easiest to use and are generally recommended.
    The remainder of this section shows how to do it by inspection of the
    system catalogs.


    Using psql on a recently vacuumed or analyzed
    database, you can issue queries to see the disk usage of any table:


```
SELECT pg_relation_filepath(oid), relpages FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'customer';

 pg_relation_filepath | relpages
----------------------+----------
 base/16384/16806     |       60
(1 row)
```


    Each page is typically 8 kilobytes. (Remember, relpages
    is only updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and
    a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX.)  The file path name
    is of interest if you want to examine the table's disk file directly.


    To show the space used by TOAST tables, use a query
    like the following:


```
SELECT relname, relpages
FROM pg_class,
     (SELECT reltoastrelid
      FROM pg_class
      WHERE relname = 'customer') AS ss
WHERE oid = ss.reltoastrelid OR
      oid = (SELECT indexrelid
             FROM pg_index
             WHERE indrelid = ss.reltoastrelid)
ORDER BY relname;

       relname        | relpages
----------------------+----------
 pg_toast_16806       |        0
 pg_toast_16806_index |        1
```


    You can easily display index sizes, too:


```
SELECT c2.relname, c2.relpages
FROM pg_class c, pg_class c2, pg_index i
WHERE c.relname = 'customer' AND
      c.oid = i.indrelid AND
      c2.oid = i.indexrelid
ORDER BY c2.relname;

      relname      | relpages
-------------------+----------
 customer_id_index |       26
```


    It is easy to find your largest tables and indexes using this
    information:


```
SELECT relname, relpages
FROM pg_class
ORDER BY relpages DESC;

       relname        | relpages
----------------------+----------
 bigtable             |     3290
 customer             |     3144
```


## Disk Full Failure


    The most important disk monitoring task of a database administrator
    is to make sure the disk doesn't become full.  A filled data disk will
    not result in data corruption, but it might prevent useful activity
    from occurring. If the disk holding the WAL files grows full, database
    server panic and consequent shutdown might occur.


    If you cannot free up additional space on the disk by deleting
    other things, you can move some of the database files to other file
    systems by making use of tablespaces. See  for more information about that.


     Some file systems perform badly when they are almost full, so do
     not wait until the disk is completely full to take action.


    If your system supports per-user disk quotas, then the database
    will naturally be subject to whatever quota is placed on the user
    the server runs as.  Exceeding the quota will have the same bad
    effects as running out of disk space entirely.
